_Description_

Bookshelved is a full-stack application that is a digital tracker of books for users to review. Using OAuth, users will be able to sign in and create new books, read reviews of books by other users and delete their own reviews. The inital application page will display all the books on the "shelf" and allow the user to view the details of the book to add a review. Prior to adding a review, a user must login to access that element of the application.
